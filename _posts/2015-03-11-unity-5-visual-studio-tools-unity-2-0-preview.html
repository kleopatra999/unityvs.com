title: Unity 5 and Visual Studio Tools for Unity 2.0 Preview

<p>Unity 5 was released last week at GDC, and it comes with a few changes from Unity 4.</p>

<p>The Visual Studio Tools for Unity 2.0 will support Unity 5 completely, in the meantime there's
a few actions you can do to have the Visual Studio Tools for Unity 2.0 Preview work nicely with Unity 5.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio Tools Unity Package</h3>

<p>The first thing that you'll notice is that you don't find the Visual Studio Tools package in the Import Package menu.</p>

<p>You can easily import the Visual Studio Tools package by importing it manually. Chose Import Custom Package, and select our package
from:</p>
<br/>
<blockquote>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Unity\2013\</blockquote>
<br/>
<p>Alternatively, if you have the Administrator rights on your machine you can copy the package to:</p>
<br/>
<blockquote>C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Standard Assets\</blockquote>
<br/>
<p>And you'll find it in the Import Package menu next time you need it.</p>

<h3>File Opening</h3>
<br/>

<p>To properly open your scripts from Unity, you need to change the External Editor to our file opener.</p>

<p>In Unity, go to the menu Edit -> Preferences, and in the External Tools tab, change the file opener to:</p>
<br/>
<blockquote>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Unity\2013\UnityVS.OpenFile.exe</blockquote>
<br/>

<br/><br/>

<h3>Known issue</h3>
<br/>

<p>Unity 5 changed the path to the tool named pdb2mdb that we're using to convert .NET debug symbols to the Mono debug symbols that
Unity understands. You need to invoke the tool yourself on your dll and pdb files if you want to debug custom dll files.</p>

<p>Run the command:</p>

<br/>
<blockquote>C:\>"C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\MonoBleedingEdge\bin\cli.bat" "C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\MonoBleedingEdge\lib\mono\4.5\pdb2mdb.exe" Path\To\MyCustomAssembly.dll</blockquote>
<br/>

<p>Replace Path\To\MyCustomAssembly.dll by the actual path to your dll file (the .pdb needs to be located in the same folder), and this will generate a mdb file. Just copy the dll and the mdb file in the Assets folder and you'll be able to debug the code from Visual Studio.</p>
