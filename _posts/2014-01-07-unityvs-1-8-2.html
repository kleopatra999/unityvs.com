<p>Happy new year from the UnityVS team! We're kicking it off with a new release!</p>

<p><a href="/documentation/changelog/#1.8.2">UnityVS 1.8.2</a> is our second release in the 1.8 cycle. The team is already busy working on the next major release, and much like last year, we plan to visit major Unity conferences and user groups, you'll be hearing from us!</p>

<p>Again, the UnityVS team wishes you a fantastic year 2014!</p>
