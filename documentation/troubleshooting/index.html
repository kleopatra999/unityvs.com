If you are migrating an existing UnityVS 1.8 solution, we recommend that you:

<ul>
  <li>Delete the UnityVS .sln and .*proj files from the root folder of your Unity project.</li>
  <li>Import the new Visual Studio Tools for Unity package into your Unity project as shown in <a href="http://unityvs.com/documentation/configuration/">the documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>

Your new solution will be automatically generated.
